A group of long-term experts, producers, and organizers of the Digital Commons (gender-balanced albeit Western-centric) gathered in Berlin in May 2023 to discuss and strategize about the future of the open movement through a three-day session. The group came to a series of conclusions that may serve as a base to better nurture and defend the Digital Commons.

The report presented here serves as one step, summarizing and contextualizing said conclusions. It could also, potentially, be used as a tool for advocacy, organization, and action in the future.
